      <p>The history of UK BMX begins here

23rd April 1980
DAVID DUFFIELD WORKS HIS MAGIC

David Duffield (then of Halfords) contacts Gerrit Does, the man who brought BMX to Europe for the first time in his homeland of Holland as a training tool for future motorcycle moto-cross riders and founder of Stichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN).

He told him he wanted them (SFN) to come over with riders to compete at a Halfords sponsored BMX event. Mr. Duffield was also planning to visit Holland, probably during an event at the Eindhoven track. He wanted to know more about organizing BMX races, setting up tracks and was interested in the promotional films Gerrit had produced at the time.

28th April 1980
FORMALISING THE SPORT

The history behind the BMX Association development in the UK centered around a handful of people who were very keen to see it take off and sustain itself as it has done in other countries:

Alan Rushton (Sports-Plus Promotions)
Geoff Wiles (ex-speed cycle rider)
Peter Selby (filmmaker)
Don Smith (ex-motor trials rider)
All agreed to the setting up of one Association for riders, to set the rules, organize the Championships and Promotions, provide a computer listing of individual riders, countrywide classifications by age group and issue of licenses.

Mr. David Duffield of HALFORDS, who felt very strongly for the future of the sport and in the formation of just one non-profit making body, the "UK Bicycle Moto-cross Association" in short the UK.BMX.A.

Alan Rushton commented to the gathering that the story of the HARROGATE Show was BMX, and that, already exhibitors had received an amazing reaction. UK.BMX.A was not a manufacturers Association but one for the riders. With the help of Sports - Plus they intended to spread technical knowledge as rapid as possible, newsletters free of charge to competitors and associated members, product testing, and the UKBMXA would go to opening of track with bikes from all of the manufacturers to have new-comers ride on them. Also promotional materials for local Councils to convince them of BMX's future was needed and Geoff Wiles would be available to every and anyone (also within the industry) to help. This is how finally the UK.BMX.A saw the day of light, later on that same year.

HALFORDS ENTER THE FRAY

July 7th., Mr. Selby of C.I.P. England, visited with GD. Mr. Peter Selby of CIP (Crown International Productions Ltd.) London - England, visited Holland and witnessed a BMX race. Their company was getting involved in promoting BMX in England in cooperation with Halfords.

BACK TO HOLLAND WE GO

From England, people came over to Holland to look at this new sport of BMX. Geoff Wiles and Bob Phelps were getting organized in England and we were able to explain to them our situation and organization. I also introduced the English to the JAG BMX WORLD's to be held in the USA December 1980. Geoff Wiles, acting as president of the board of UK.BMX.A. invited the SFN to come over with a team of riders to be present at the official opening of their new track at REDDITCH, later on this year.
